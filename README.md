## Introduction

Fake news detection is a critical task in the current digital age to ensure the integrity of information. This project uses machine learning algorithms to classify news articles as fake or real based on their content.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of news articles labeled as fake or real. The data is assumed to be in CSV format and stored in the appropriate directory.

## Installation

To run the notebook, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn

You can install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy nltk scikit-learn
```

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-news-predict.git
    cd fake-news-predict
    ```

2. Start Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

3. Open `Fake News Prediction.ipynb` and run the cells to see the analysis and prediction steps.

## Models Used

The notebook explores various machine learning models, including:

- Logistic Regression
- Naive Bayes (BernoulliNB)

## Results

The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

## Contributing
